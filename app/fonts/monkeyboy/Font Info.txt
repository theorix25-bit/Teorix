This font was created by Nate Piekos for BLAMBOT Free Comic Lettering Fonts.
It is completely free, and you should feel free to do with it what you like so long as you don't try to pass it off as your own, or charge anyone a fee to use it. All I ask is that you keep this text file with the distribution of my font to give me credit.

Thanks and enjoy!
